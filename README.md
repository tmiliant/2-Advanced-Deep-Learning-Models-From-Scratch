# 2-Advanced-Deep-Learning-Models-From-Scratch

I implemented the algorithms presented in the following two papers https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142, https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424 from scratch, using PyTorch, and coded in the Vim editor.
I also implemented a factory method that allows to decide, at runtime, which of the models to use.
